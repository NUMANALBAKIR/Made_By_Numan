# Important Notes :
1. Contents of appsettings.json of project 'Client' are hidden as they are app secrets. 
But, if you are a Job-Employer and would like to run my project, please let me know by emailing to address on my resume; I can send you contents of appsettings.json.

2. You'll get an error if you run the projects without contents of appsettings.json.

3. Projects 'Client' (ASP.NET Core MVC) and 'API' are complete. 
Projects 'Client-Angular' and 'API-Angular' are incomplete, as currently under-development.
