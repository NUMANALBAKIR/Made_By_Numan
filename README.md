# Important Notes :

1. Contents of appsettings.json of project 'Client' are hidden as they are app secrets. 
But, if you are a Job-Employer and would like to run my project, please let me know by emailing to address on my resume; I will send you contents of appsettings.json.

2. I've implemented design patterns and principles in Project 'API'; so, didn't implement those again in project 'API-Angular', to save time.
